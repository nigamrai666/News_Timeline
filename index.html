                function in an interrelated way. The structure and composition is determined by various
                environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic
                modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere,
                radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.</p>

            <p class="secsubtag text-small">The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have
                occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial
                Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms
                possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the
                process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

            <p class="sectag text-big">The future of nature is plants and animals</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small">Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which
                generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became
                the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae
                as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were
                removed to new kingdoms.</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small">Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them
                apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa),
                which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.</p>
